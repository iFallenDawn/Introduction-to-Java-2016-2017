# Introduction to Java 2016-2017
This repo consists of various projects and assignments given to us during our Introduction to Java class in the 2016-2017 school year. Projects range from (but are not limited) to learning about Arrays, Strings, Data Types to American Computer Science League (ACSL) problems.

## Lights Out!
This was my take on the classic game, Lights Out! using Java and implementing a GUI for it.

Taken from Wikipedia:
```
Lights Out is an electronic game released by Tiger Electronics in 1995. The game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. 
When the game starts, a random number or a stored pattern of these lights is switched on. 
Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the adjacent lights.
```
